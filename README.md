# Practical-Machine-Learning

In this course project I have been asked to predict the manner in which some enthusiastic people, who do exercises, take measurements about themselves using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit.  It is now possible to collect large amounts of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. 

These type of devices are part of the quantified self movement where these folks take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. 

In this project, my primary goal is to use data from these accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways.
